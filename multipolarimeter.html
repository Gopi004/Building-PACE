    </center>
    <h3>The Multi-Angle Polarimeter (MAP) is one of the advanced instruments onboard NASA’s PACE (Plankton, Aerosol, Cloud, ocean Ecosystem) satellite. Its primary purpose is to measure the properties of aerosols and clouds by analyzing how sunlight is scattered in the atmosphere. Understanding aerosols and clouds is crucial for studying their impact on climate and air quality, as well as their interactions with each other and with sunlight.</h3>
    <h2 style="color: skyblue;">WORKING</h2>
    <h3>A polarimeter measures the polarization of light, which is the orientation of light waves as they travel. Sunlight becomes polarized when it interacts with particles in the atmosphere, such as aerosols (tiny particles like dust, smoke, and sea salt) and cloud droplets. By examining this polarized light from multiple angles (hence, “multi-angle”), the instrument can determine the size, shape, composition, and distribution of aerosols and cloud particles.</h3>
    <h2 style="color: skyblue;">KEY MEASUREMENTS</h2>
    <h3 style="color: darkgreen;">Aerosol Properties</h3>
    <h3>Aerosols scatter sunlight in specific ways depending on their composition and size. The MAP captures the scattered light at different angles to analyze these properties, providing detailed information on the types of aerosols (e.g., dust, smoke, sea salt) present in the atmosphere.</h3>
      <h3 style="color: darkgreen;">  Cloud Properties
        </h3>
        <h3> The instrument also studies cloud particles, measuring their shape, size, and how they reflect sunlight. This helps to understand the role of clouds in reflecting or absorbing solar energy, which is critical to Earth's energy balance.</h3>

        </h3>
        <h3> By observing the same spot on Earth from multiple angles, the MAP can provide a more complete and accurate picture of how aerosols and clouds scatter light, offering insights into their physical characteristics.</h3>
